FILE 2: charting-m-points-2020s.csv
Point-level data. One row per point. This is the core file for the simulation.
Also applies to charting-m-points-2010s.csv and charting-m-points-to-2009.csv
=============================================================================
 
match_id    : Links to charting-m-matches.csv. Same format as above.
 
Pt          : Point number within the match, sequential from 1.
              Use this to replay the match in order.
 
Set1        : Sets won by Player 1 so far at the START of this point
Set2        : Sets won by Player 2 so far at the START of this point
 
Gm1         : Games won by Player 1 in the current set at the START of this point
Gm2         : Games won by Player 2 in the current set at the START of this point
 
Pts         : Score within the current game at the START of this point.
              Standard game:   0-0, 15-0, 30-15, 40-30, AD-40, 40-AD etc.
              Tiebreak game:   0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 6-6, 7-6 etc. (numeric not tennis scoring)
              NOTE: To detect if a point is in a tiebreak, check Gm1==6 and Gm2==6
              (or Gm1==3 and Gm2==3 for NextGen Finals 4-game sets)
 
Gm#         : Overall game number in the match (sequential across all sets)
 
TbSet       : Boolean. True if this SET uses a tiebreak format.
              WARNING: This is a SET-level flag not a POINT-level flag.
              It being True does NOT mean this specific point is in a tiebreak.
              In practice almost always True for ATP matches post-2000.
 
Svr         : Which player is serving this point. 1 = Player 1, 2 = Player 2
 
1st         : Shot sequence string for the point if the first serve was in play.
              If starts with 'c' = serve was called out but overruled (let replayed)
              If just 'S' = serve went in but rally not charted
              If just 'R' = return not charted
              See SHOT SEQUENCE NOTATION section below for full decoding
 
2nd         : Shot sequence string if there was a second serve (first serve was a fault)
              Same notation as 1st. If both 1st and 2nd are populated, 1st was a fault.
 
Notes       : Free text match notes e.g. "Kyrgios serves underarm",
              "Successful challenge from Thiem", "Match length: 2 hours 34 minutes"
 
PtWinner    : Which player won this point. 1 = Player 1, 2 = Player 2
